Analysis:
Univariate Analysis: Distribution of car prices, kilometers driven, fuel types, etc.
Bivariate Analysis: Relationship between car price and variables like car age, kilometers driven, etc.
Multivariate Analysis: Combined key factors to uncover deeper trends.
Visualization: Created meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Key Insights
Market Trends
Market Leaders: Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai dominate the market.
Ownership Insights:
First-owner cars retain higher value and exhibit wider price ranges.
